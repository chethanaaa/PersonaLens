Video Analysis
Engagement and Focus

Total Blinks: 18
Total Gaze Outside Frame: 6
Total Yawns: 4
Interpretations:

Engagement: The candidate displayed strong engagement, with minimal gaze deviations and controlled blinking. Frequent blinks during specific intervals indicate attentiveness but may suggest slight nervousness or natural fatigue.
Fatigue and Stress: Yawns detected in later stages suggest mild fatigue. While gaze remained within the frame most of the time, shifts may imply brief moments of distraction or cognitive overload.
Limitations:

Results require validation to rule out potential technical errors in blink and gaze detection.
Further data (e.g., head movements or posture analysis) could provide more context.
Audio Analysis
Nervousness and Confidence

Confidence: Variations in RMS energy indicate fluctuating confidence levels, improving towards the end of the interview.
Nervousness: High spectral bandwidth and erratic tempos at certain timestamps highlight initial nervousness.
Key Observations:

Vocal tone remained consistent, avoiding shrillness, which positively reflects the candidateâ€™s ability to maintain vocal control under pressure.
Limitations:

Correlation with context from video and text analysis could better explain vocal irregularities.
