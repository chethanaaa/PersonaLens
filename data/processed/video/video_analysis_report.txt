Based on the provided data from the video analysis, here are some specific insights into the person's behavior:

## Total Blinks: 115
- The number of blinks can be an indicator of various physiological and psychological states. However, without a baseline or context of what is considered normal for this individual, it is challenging to draw definitive conclusions. Generally, an average person blinks around 12-15 times per minute. If the video is of a reasonable length (e.g., several minutes), 115 blinks might be within a normal range, suggesting that the person's blink rate is not unusually high or low.

## Total Gaze Outside Frame: 0
- This indicates that the person did not look outside the frame of the video during the observed period. This could suggest that the person was fully engaged with the content or task within the frame and did not divert their attention to anything outside of it. It implies a high level of focus and engagement with the subject matter being observed.

## Total Yawns: 0
- The absence of yawns is a strong indicator that the person was not experiencing significant fatigue during the video recording. Yawning is often associated with tiredness, boredom, or stress. Since there were no yawns detected, it suggests that the person was likely alert and not feeling overly tired or bored.

### Overall Analysis
- **Engagement:** The fact that the person's gaze remained within the frame and there were no yawns suggests a high level of engagement with the content or task at hand.
- **Fatigue:** The absence of yawns and a blink rate that appears to be within normal limits indicate that the person was not experiencing significant fatigue during the video.
- **Stress:** While the data does not directly measure stress, the lack of yawns and the focused gaze within the frame could imply that the person was not under undue stress or discomfort during the recording.

In summary, the data suggests that the person was engaged, alert, and not experiencing significant fatigue or stress during the video analysis.
