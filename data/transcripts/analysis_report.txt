**Transcript:**

[Interviewer]: So are you currently working right now or you're not working?
[Candidate]: No, I want to ask this question.
[Interviewer]: The hours a week. Why do you think your hours a week?
[Candidate]: What's something that you have kids and what project that hours a week you think that you would like to do?
[Interviewer]: What is something that it's a normal week for you?
[Candidate]: Okay, normal hours of work is 40 hours a week. I can work full time because my kids are very independent. They know already that I'm a freelancer. So they're very independent and there's no problem with my kids. I can work full time for 40 hours a week, eight hours a day.
[Interviewer]: All right, so we have the wage of three or seven is that negotiable? Pardon is your wage negotiable?
[Candidate]: Yes, yes, yes.
[Interviewer]: Well, the whole thing here is this, right? Since we're a startup, right? We're actually there's no investment with the investment. We don't have outside investors. We're actually doing the investing.
[Candidate]: So that's the reason we ask, but the long term thing is that we want is we already have a virtual assistant. And then the future, we actually, this is the beginning, right? There is a start, but we'll make sure that we do the right thing at the end.
[Interviewer]: I mean, I know that I know that the rate on whatever we negotiate might not be something I might not look at value, but we do appreciate the people that we work with.
[Candidate]: We already have one virtual assistant who has put out so much work. We went away from upwork and now he's making better money and he's doing well with this.
[Interviewer]: And at the end, you know, we're looking at that the virtual assistance to be actually building your own team.
[Candidate]: That's what we want in the long term, you know, your managing. Yeah, we're looking for someone that is going to be there wrong term, but, but bringing their own, you know, their own people that they can take out of me, your standards.
[Interviewer]: I guess you could say when you're building out your own team, because you have more experience in that field. So you know what people are trying to get over on you.
[Candidate]: I don't want to, I don't want to have to go out and build your team for you. Like I do that stuff for these people, but it's better you do it because you have the experience, you know, and you can ask them the questions and you know the answers.
[Interviewer]: So it's kind of what we're looking for like so much at the top of that could delegate stuff later on when the team expands.
[Candidate]: It's all about it's all about a team here, you know, like I said to you, you're going to see when you meet the other lead managers. And then when we really, if we do hire you, you'll see the whole team that we have we just all like this full of energy and down to earth.
[Interviewer]: We're not here to impose ourselves like I said once again it's not about us to title with a senior guy. See obviously in the company, but the rest I say kids because they're kids.
[Candidate]: Yeah, they have a lot of heart. You know, we love you. They liked our kids. One is my nephew is like my kid, but the rest are like our kids, which you know we give him empowerment.
[Interviewer]: We give him, you know, a lot of a lot of support. And you know, they do so much. And that's the future future.
[Candidate]: And then we look in for you know, like I said, the right individual, like you could have all the talent in the world, but if you can't work with people and, and you know, and work as a team, then it doesn't work for us.
[Interviewer]: We had, we had many that we interviewed and looked at will like, well, this person really talented, but it wasn't a thing. I mean, we just didn't feel anything of that connection.
[Candidate]: That's what I want. I think that even you could be less talented. Maybe the other person might be might have more of the time, but you want that passion and drive you wanting to go that extra mile that's and those things that that's what really works.
[Interviewer]: So right now you're, you know, just steps away. So, like you a lot. I mean, I have to have to say that, you know, a bad here is not easy for for him to really connect with someone because he is more the tech guy.
[Candidate]: I'm more a customer service.
[Interviewer]: So one more thing with customer services. I'm into customer service.
[Candidate]: If there is a, let's say a customer online who is actually mad or it's not happy about something that that that online, how would you handle, you know, customers when what's the rule of customer service?
[Interviewer]: What is the rule actually, and how would you handle. So, in customers in customer service number one is you should not use your emotions. If you are in the customer sales representative or customer service representative, you should not use your emotion. You should put your shoe on the shoe of the customer.
[Candidate]: So you should understand the customer.
[Interviewer]: Okay. So the next thing. Excuse me. I have a allergy. Sorry.
[Candidate]: So the next thing if we understand. Listen, that's what we're going to do is we don't, we lose you and we don't hire you. We're going to be crying too.
[Interviewer]: Okay. That's my problem. Early in the morning. I have allergic rhinitis.
[Candidate]: But if I ate my breakfast, it's gone.
[Interviewer]: So. Yeah. Well, you're on the right track. I mean, you know, customers always write that's what the rule of customer service. And you always always, not no confrontations and diffusing the problem is always get if you can't, you give it to the manager and we'll take care of it. And that's it.
[Candidate]: But that's that's the last thing I wanted to say.
[Interviewer]: But, you know, thank you so much for your time. I don't know if you have any more questions for us. Anything.
[Candidate]: No, Angel, right. Yeah, I'm angel.
[Interviewer]: So let me, let me right here. I'm on LinkedIn. Angel. If you want to write this down, angel.
[Candidate]: Okay, let me see if I write it here. Hold on. You'll find me here. Hold on. Let me write it here. That you'll find me on LinkedIn. That's where I'm at. And you can see more. I mean, obviously, I'm not the expert of social media.
[Interviewer]: So I've been there for 33 years and that's where I have everyone. Everyone that you see there, the connection is more than the whole thing.
[Candidate]: I'm just waiting for you. Okay. Yeah. All right.
[Interviewer]: That's that's my connection on LinkedIn. Okay.
[Candidate]: And then you support excitement on, do you know on the Instagram what it is? That's the answer. That's the answer. That's the grammar right here.
[Interviewer]: Okay. So it's great to meet you. We're very happy that we had this interview.
[Candidate]: You did very well. You're enthusiasm and how you present yourself is excellent.
[Interviewer]: So it's just the next step with with the next next two individuals who are very, you know, they're very particular about who they want to hire but they're great kids though.
[Candidate]: Yeah. And it's good that they are very detail oriented and they want the best person for the company because they really care about us and wanting the success for everybody.
[Interviewer]: All right. Right. Yes. That's right.
[Candidate]: Okay. Thank you so much for angel answer, Abba. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
[Interviewer]: And I have been here to you and your family. Yes. No, that's for you.
[Candidate]: Take care. Thank you so much. Looking forward. Thanks so much. Bye.
